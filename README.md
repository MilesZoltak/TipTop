# Tip Calculator 

## Miles Zoltak

**TipTop** computes the tip and total amount for a bill. The app uses the base amount and tip percentage to calculate the amount owed, and it also describes the quality of service based on the tip.

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can enter in a bill amount (total amount to tip on)
* [x] User can enter a tip percentage (what % the user wants to tip).
* [x] The tip and total amount are updated immediately when any of the inputs changes.
* [x] The user sees a label or color update based on the tip amount. 

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* [x] Custom colors palette selected
* [x] Depending on the value of the tip percent, the tip description is an emoji that gets updated as the percent changes
* [x] Added a footer that says Made in CS 194A by Miles! (surrounded by little tree emojis)

## Notes

It wasn't too bad making this app.  But when I was trying to push it to GitHub from the command line I accidentally deleted the entire
project, so that was a bit of a bummer.  Other that that it was pretty smooth.  Initially I had trouble with the emulator but I resolved
that and then there were just a couple really silly things that were just a part of getting to know Kotlin and Android Studio.
